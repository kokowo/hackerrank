		Output: 58
		Explanation: The optimal way to connect ropes is as follows
		1. Connect the ropes of length 4 and 6 (cost is 10). Ropes after connecting: [8, 10, 12]
		2. Connect the ropes of length 8 and 10 (cost is 18). Ropes after connecting: [18, 12]
		3. Connect the ropes of length 18 and 12 (cost is 30).
		Total cost to connect the ropes is 10 + 18 + 30 = 58
